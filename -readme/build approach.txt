Build Approach: Hybrid (Best of Both Worlds)
Here's what we'll do:
Step 1: I create complete file structure HERE

I'll generate all the code in this chat
Full Next.js app with Supabase integration
You can see everything before running anything

Step 2: You create GitHub repo

Create new repo: protocol (or protocol-app)
Initialize locally: git init
Copy files I provide
Push to your repo

Step 3: Local development

npm install
Set up Supabase (I'll give you exact steps)
npm run dev
Test locally

Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

Connect repo to Vercel (like Swoletron)
Add environment variables
Deploy
