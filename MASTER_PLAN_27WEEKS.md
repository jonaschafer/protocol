## Training Principles

### The 10% Rule (Non-Negotiable)
- Weekly mileage increases max 10% per week
- "Feeling good" = yellow flag, not green light
- Bank miles Tuesday = steal from Thursday workout quality

### Deload Weeks (Strategic Recovery)
- Drop to 70% of previous week's volume
- Maintain vert where possible (Tuesday group run)
- Keep workout intensity, reduce volume
- Non-negotiable even if feeling strong
- Foundation: Weeks 4, 8
- Durability: Weeks 13, 17, 20
- Specificity: Week 24

### Front-Loading Warning
- Your aerobic system recovers faster than tissues
- 8+ weeks needed for musculoskeletal adaptation
- Starting from 12mpw requires patience

### Shuffle Running Strategy
- Foundation Phase: Walk breaks encouraged on >6% grades
- Durability Phase: Progressive continuous uphill work
  - Week 18: 500ft continuous
  - Week 19: 750ft continuous
  - Week 20: 1000ft continuous (test before deload)
- Specificity Phase: Race-specific continuous climbs
- Supported by daily PT exercises (calf/hip flexor endurance)

### Weekly Structure
- **Monday:** Rest + PT Foundation (Weeks 1-9 only)
- **Tuesday:** Group run (6-8mi, 1500ft) + Heavy strength + PT (Weeks 1-9)
- **Wednesday:** Easy run + PT (Weeks 1-9)
- **Thursday:** Quality workout + Heavy strength + PT (Weeks 1-9)
- **Friday:** Easy run OR rowing + PT (Weeks 1-9)
- **Saturday:** Rest + PT (Weeks 1-9)
- **Sunday:** Long run + PT (Weeks 1-9)

### Strength Training
- **PT Foundation (Weeks 1-9):** **DAILY comprehensive PT (20-25min)** + heavy 2x/week
- **Runner Maintenance (Weeks 10-27):** Heavy 2x/week + maintenance 3x/week (10-15min)
- **Race Week (Aug 10-15):** Maintenance only
